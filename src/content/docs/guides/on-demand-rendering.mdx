Your Astro project code must be **rendered** to HTML in order to be displayed on the web. 

Astro pages, routes, and API endpoints can be either [pre-rendered at build time](#prerendered-pages) as static pages or [rendered on demand by a server](#on-demand-rendered-routes) when a route is requested. On-demand rendering requires an adapter to execute code on the server, while prerendered pages are served as static HTML.

- `output: 'static'` (default): Routes are prerendered at build time. You can opt-out of prerendering on any individual route.
- `output: 'server'` (app mode): All routes are rendered on the server on demand by default. You can opt-in to prerendering on any individual route.

<ReadMore>See more about the [`output` setting](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#output) in the configuration reference.</ReadMore>

**By default, your entire Astro site will be prerendered**, and static HTML pages will be sent to the browser. If you have some pages that require server rendering, for example, a page that checks for cookies and displays personalized content, you can choose to render these individual routes on demand. The rest of your site will be a static site.

For a **highly dynamic app**, set your build output configuration to server-render all your pages by default. Then, you can choose to prerender any individual pages that do not require a server to execute, such as a privacy policy or about page.

## Opting in or out of prerendering

Both of Astro's rendering modes allow you to prerender and render on demand in the same project. The only difference is which kind of rendering happens by default.

You can set a `prerender` value (`true` or `false`) in your page route to opt in or out of prerendering and override your output's default mode.

<ReadMore>See more about [adding an adapter and using on-demand rendering](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/) for some or all of your routes.</ReadMore>

### Prerendered pages

<p>

**`'static'`:** by default<br/>
**`'server'`:** with `export const prerender = true`
</p>

Prerendered pages are built ahead of time and ready to send to the browser. The same HTML document is sent to the browser for every visitor, and a full-site rebuild is required to update the contents of the page. This method is also known as **static site generation (SSG)**. 

By default, all Astro projects are configured to be pre-rendered at build time (statically generated) to provide the most lightweight browser experience. The browser does not need to wait for any HTML to build because the server does not need to generate any pages on demand. Your site is not dependent on the performance of a backend data source, and once built, will remain available to visitors as a static site as long as your server is functioning.

Prerendered pages in Astro can still include Astro features such as:

- [Client islands](/en/concepts/islands/) for interactive UI components in an otherwise static, pre-rendered page.
- [Server islands](/en/guides/server-islands/) for rendering dynamic or personalized content within a static page shell.
- [View transitions](/en/guides/view-transitions/) for client-side routing with animation and state persistence across page navigation.
- [Middleware](/en/guides/middleware/) (with some limitations) to intercept and transform response data from a request.

:::tip
Astro's default `static` mode is a powerful, modern-feeling choice for content-focused sites with the ability to add individual on-demand routes for dynamic or personalized pages when needed.

### On-demand rendered routes

<p>

**`'static'`:** with `export const prerender = false` and an adapter<br />
**`'server'`:** by default, with an adapter
</p>
  
Since on-demand routes are generated per visit, they can be customized for each viewer. For example, a page rendered on demand can show a logged-in user their account information or display freshly updated data without requiring a full-site rebuild. On-demand rendering on the server at request time is also known as **server-side rendering (SSR)**.

<ReadMore>Read more about [features available with on-demand rendering and an adapter](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/#on-demand-rendering-features), such as cookies, Response and Request objects, HTML streaming, and more.</ReadMore>

You may want to render a route on demand if you need the following:

- **API endpoints**: Create specific pages that function as API endpoints for tasks like database access, authentication, and authorization while keeping sensitive data hidden from the client.

- **Protected pages**: Restrict access to a page based on user privileges, by handling user access on the server.

- **Frequently changing content**: Generate individual pages without requiring a static rebuild of your site. This is useful when the content of a page updates frequently, for example displaying data from an API called dynamically with `fetch()`.

:::tip
On-demand server rendering in Astro, especially when combined with [view transitions](/en/guides/view-transitions/), provides a true app experience without the JavaScript overhead of a client-side, single-page application. Even highly dynamic, interactive apps are possible.
:::


Astro allows you to choose **on-demand rendering** for some, or all of your pages and endpoints. 

Generating HTML pages on the server when requested and sending them to the client is also known as **server-side rendering (SSR)**. An **adapter** is used to run your project on the server and handle these requests.

## Official Adapters

Astro maintains official adapters for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). 

Find even more [community-maintained adapters](https://astro.build/integrations/?search=&categories%5B%5D=adapters) (e.g. Deno, SST, AWS) in our integrations directory. 


### Add an Adapter

To render any of your pages on demand, for any `output` mode, you need to add an **adapter**.

Each adapter allows Astro to output a script that runs your project on a specific *runtime*: the environment that runs code on the server to generate pages when they are requested (e.g. Netlify, Cloudflare).

You can find both [official and community adapters in our integrations directory](https://astro.build/integrations/?search=&categories%5B%5D=adapters). Choose the one that corresponds to your [deployment environment](/en/guides/deploy/).

You can add any of the [official adapters maintained by Astro](/en/guides/integrations-guide/#official-integrations) with the following `astro add` command. This will install the adapter and make the appropriate changes to your `astro.config.mjs` file in one step. 

For example, to install the Netlify adapter, run:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  npx astro add netlify
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  pnpm astro add netlify
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  yarn astro add netlify
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

You can also [add an adapter manually by installing the NPM package](/en/guides/integrations-guide/#installing-an-npm-package) (e.g. `@astrojs/netlify`) and updating `astro.config.mjs` yourself.

Note that different adapters may have different configuration settings. Read each adapter's documentation, and apply any necessary config options to your chosen adapter in `astro.config.mjs`

## Opting out of prerendering in `static` mode

For a mostly static site configured as `output: static` (Astro's default), add `export const prerender = false` to any files that should be server-rendered on demand:

```js title="src/pages/randomnumber.js" {1}
export const prerender = false;

export async function GET() {
  let number = Math.random();
  return new Response(
    JSON.stringify({
      number,
      message: `Here's a random number: ${number}`,
    }),
  );
}
```

## Opting in to prerendering in `server` mode

With `output: server` configured, add `export const prerender = true` to any page or route to prerender a static page or endpoint:

```astro title="src/pages/mypage.astro" {2}
---
export const prerender = true;
// ...
---
<html>
  <!-- Static, pre-rendered page here... -->
</html>
```

```mdx title="src/pages/mypage.mdx" {5}
---
layout: '../layouts/markdown.astro'
title: 'My page'
---
export const prerender = true;

# This is my static, pre-rendered page
```

```js title="src/pages/myendpoint.js" {1}
export const prerender = true;

export async function GET() {
  return new Response(
    JSON.stringify({
      message: `This is my static endpoint`,
    }),
  );
}
```

## On-demand rendering features

### HTML streaming

With HTML streaming, a document is broken up into chunks, sent over the network in order, and rendered on the page in that order. Astro uses HTML streaming in on-demand rendering to send each component to the browser as it renders them. This makes sure the user sees your HTML as fast as possible, although network conditions can cause large documents to be downloaded slowly, and waiting for data fetches can block page rendering.

<RecipeLinks slugs={["en/recipes/streaming-improve-page-performance"]}/>

:::caution
Features that modify the [Response headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header) are only available at the **page level**. (You can't use them inside of components, including layout components.) By the time Astro runs your component code, it has already sent the Response headers and they cannot be modified.

:::

### Cookies

A page or API endpoint rendered on demand can check, set, get, and delete cookies.

The example below updates the value of a cookie for a page view counter:

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" {6,7,12}
---
export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode

let counter = 0

if (Astro.cookies.has('counter')) {
  const cookie = Astro.cookies.get('counter')
  const value = cookie?.number()
  if (value !== undefined && !isNaN(value)) counter = value + 1
}

Astro.cookies.set('counter', String(counter))
---
<html>
  <h1>Counter = {counter}</h1>
</html>
```

See more details about [`Astro.cookies` and the `AstroCookie` type](/en/reference/api-reference/#astrocookies) in the API reference.

### `Response`

[`Astro.response`](/en/reference/api-reference/#astroresponse) is a standard [`ResponseInit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Response#options) object. It can be used to set the response status and headers.

The example below sets a response status and status text for a product listing page when the product does not exist:

```astro title="src/pages/my-product.astro" {10,11}
---
export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode

import { getProduct } from '../api';

const product = await getProduct(Astro.params.id);

// No product found
if (!product) {
  Astro.response.status = 404;
  Astro.response.statusText = 'Not found';
}
---
<html>
  <!-- Page here... -->
</html>
```

#### `Astro.response.headers`

You can set headers using the `Astro.response.headers` object:

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" {4}
---
export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode

Astro.response.headers.set('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=3600');
---
<html>
  <!-- Page here... -->
</html>
```

#### Return a `Response` object

You can also return a [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) object directly from any page using on-demand rendering. 

The example below returns a 404 on a dynamic page after looking up an ID in the database:

```astro title="src/pages/[id].astro" {10-13}
---
export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode

import { getProduct } from '../api';

const product = await getProduct(Astro.params.id);

// No product found
if (!product) {
  return new Response(null, {
    status: 404,
    statusText: 'Not found'
  });
}
---
<html>
  <!-- Page here... -->
</html>
```

### `Request`

`Astro.request` is a standard [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) object. It can be used to get the `url`, `headers`, `method`, and even the body of the request.

You can access additional information from this object for pages that are not statically generated.

#### `Astro.request.headers`

The headers for the request are available on `Astro.request.headers`. This works like the browser's [`Request.headers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/headers). It is a [Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers) object where you can retrieve headers such as the cookie.

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" {4}
---
export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode

const cookie = Astro.request.headers.get('cookie');
// ...
---
<html>
  <!-- Page here... -->
</html>
```

#### `Astro.request.method`

The HTTP method used in the request is available as `Astro.request.method`. This works like the browser's [`Request.method`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/method). It returns the string representation of the HTTP method used in the request.

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" {4}
---
export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode

console.log(Astro.request.method) // GET (when navigated to in the browser)
---
```

See more details about [`Astro.request`](/en/reference/api-reference/#astrorequest) in the API reference.

### Server Endpoints

A server endpoint, also known as an **API route**, is a special function exported from a `.js` or `.ts` file within the `src/pages/` folder. A powerful feature of server-side rendering on demand, API routes are able to securely execute code on the server.

The function takes an [endpoint context](/en/reference/api-reference/#endpoint-context) and returns a [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response). 

To learn more, see our [Endpoints Guide](/en/guides/endpoints/#server-endpoints-api-routes).
